Step-by-Step Roadmap for Building a Simple Rental Website Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

1. Set Up Project Structure
   a. Create a folder for your project, e.g., rental-website.
   b. Inside the folder, create the following files:
   c. index.html for the main page.
   d. styles.css for the design and layout.
   e. script.js for interactivity and functionality.
   f. Optionally, create an assets/ folder to store images and other media.


2. Design the Basic Layout (HTML & CSS)
Header Section:
      Include a site title (e.g., "Rental Website") and navigation links for Login and Sign Up.
Main Section:
      Display the available rental products like apartments, cars, etc., with images, names, prices, and a Rent Now button.
Footer Section:
      Add a simple footer for copyright or additional links.
Styling:
      Use CSS for layout, styling buttons, images, modals, and overall page design.


3. Implement User Authentication (JavaScript)
Sign Up Modal:
    Create a form with fields for email and password.
     Add functionality to allow users to sign up by saving their data (using browser storage like localStorage for simplicity).
Login Modal:
     Create a form for existing users to log in by validating their email and password from stored data.
User Sessions:
      After login, hide the Login and Sign Up buttons, and show a welcome message.


4. Create the Rental Functionality
     Display different products available for rent (e.g., apartments, cars) with details like name, price, and image.
Rent Now Button:
    When the user clicks Rent Now, check if they are logged in.
    If logged in, display a success message or simulate the renting process.
    If not logged in, prompt the user to log in first.


5. Add Simple Interactivity (JavaScript)
Modals:
   Implement login and sign-up modals that open when the respective buttons are clicked.
   Create close buttons for modals to close when clicked.
Form Validation:
   Validate the email and password fields during sign-up and login.
User Feedback:
      Show alert messages (e.g., "Sign up successful", "Login successful", or "Please log in to rent a product").


6. Implement Local Data Storage
      Use localStorage to store user data (email and password) during sign-up.
     Upon login, retrieve data from localStorage to validate users.
      Track the logged-in state to allow access to certain features, like renting a product.


7. Add Basic Payment Simulation
       For simplicity, simulate the payment process (no real payment gateway integration).
       When the user rents a product, display a message indicating a successful rental.
       Optionally, store rental transactions in localStorage as a history.


8. Testing and Debugging
      Test user registration, login, and product renting to ensure everything functions as expected.
      Make sure that modal windows open and close properly.
      Check that only logged-in users can rent products.
